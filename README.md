# JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Description

The task at hand was to modify starter code given that generates random passwords based on the criteria set by the user. This project was built in anticipation of certain employees having access to sensitive data within an organization. The motivation behind this was to provide an extra layer of security through strong passwords that are generated through our application. The implementation of this application will help prevent any threatening entities from reaching any sensitive information stored in the database.

## Usage

The following objectives that were completed to fulfill creating an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected are as follows...

- Ensured that the application was responsive whenever the user interacted with the button or prompts
- Gave the user full control in the different options of character types they want to include in their random password
- Generated an output that had a randomized password which matched the criteria to that of the user
- Certified that the format of the application can be viewed on different screening devices
